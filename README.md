# Web Development Project 7 - *Crewmates*

Submitted by: **Amy Wong**

This web app: **This website displays the card of each player with their rank and main agent they play on Valorant. You can use it to find people and add them to your team. Good luck on climbing!**

Time spent: **24** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **A create form allows users to add new cremates**
- [x] **Users can name the crewmate and set the crewmate's attributes by clicking on one of several values**
- [x] **The site displays a summary page of all the user's added crewmates**
- [x] **A previously created crewmate can be updated from the crewmate list**
- [x] **A previously created crewmate can be deleted from the crewmate list**
- [x] **Each crewmate has a direct, unique link to an info page about them**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

Getting the site to display the agent details is probably the hardest as I have to create a separate JSON file for this to work. The paths for the images to display would work on one page and then the other wouldn't. I still definitely have a lot to learn with backend development but I'm grateful for working on this project. I wanted to at least make sure that it's functional and I will get into the CSS on my free time!
